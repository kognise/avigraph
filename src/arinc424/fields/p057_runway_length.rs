    The "Runway Length" field defines the total length of the runway surface declared
    suitable and available for ground operations of aircraft for the runway identified in the
    records' Runway Identifier field.

    Runway lengths are derived from official government sources and are entered in feet with
    a resolution of one foot. The value represents the overall length of the runway, with no
    regard for displaced thresholds. It does not include stopways, overruns or clearways.
    Available landing lengths and take-off runs are not necessarily identical to this runway
    length. Analysis of the content of Section 5.69, Displaced Threshold and 5.79, Stopway is
    required to determine these operational lengths. As the latitude/longitude information in
    the runway record reflects the Landing Threshold Point of the runway identified in the
    record, which may or may not be displaced, there is no direct correlation between the
    Runway Length and a value calculated based on these latitude/longitude values.
